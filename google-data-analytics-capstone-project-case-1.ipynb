The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.\n\nPhase 1- Ask:\nBusiness Tasks : Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.\nStakeholders\n●Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n●Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.\n●Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n\nPhase 2 - Prepare:\nI will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions.
